# Stover

## What is Stover?

**Stover** is a desktop application that classifies **green canopy cover**, **crop residue**, and **bare soil** from downward-facing images captured with cameras or mobile devices. It helps quantify field surface cover for agronomic, environmental, and research applications.

Trained on images from **corn, sorghum, soybean, sunflower, and wheat** fields, Stover may also perform well in other cropping systems.
For the most accurate **residue estimates**, capture images when little or no live vegetation is present.
📸 **Tip:** Take photos about 2–3 ft (0.6–0.9 m) above the ground to capture fine residue details. For broader coverage, take multiple photos instead of raising the camera higher.
